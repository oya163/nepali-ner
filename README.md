# Nepali NLP Research

In this repository, I will be learning how to work with Nepali language for NLP research.

- Corpus creation
- Dataset creation (Train/Test) csv formatted
- Nepali text preprocessing
- Nepali word2vec
- Character to Character Nepali names generation using RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs

Nepali corpus is provided by [Bal Krishna Bal] (http://ku.edu.np/cse/faculty/bal/ ), Professor, Kathmandu University.

Thanks to Anushree for helping me in collecting Nepali names.
